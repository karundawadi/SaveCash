# SaveCash

SaveCash is an application designed to make managing money easy. We do this by allowing you to visualize your budget as well as categorizing your expenditures for a better understanding of your money habit. 

SaveCash aims to protect your privacy. Therefore, all information you enter into the application remains on your phone. In spite of this, all the data can be backed up to your cloud account (iCloud for iOS and Google Drive for Android).

We at SaveCash believe that managing money should be simple and straightforward for everyone. For this reason, the project is open source. Feel free to browse the code of the application and suggest improvements.
